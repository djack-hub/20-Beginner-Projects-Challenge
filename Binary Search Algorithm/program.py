#Step 1: Create a function that takes a list and a target parameter as input
#Step 2: Create Multiple variables: start, middle, end, steps (amount of splits)
#Step 3: Write function using recursion or a while loop
#Step 4: Increase steps each time a split is completed
#Step 5: Include conditions to track target position
