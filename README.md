# 20-Beginner-Projects-Challenge

In order to practice my python skills, I will be completing 20 Python coding projects as shown in on this FreeCodeCamp article: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/20-beginner-python-projects/.

The coding projects are as follows: 

| Project                   | Description                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Email Sender              | In this project, I used email.message, ssl, and smtplib to generate and send an email to a specified receiver using my gmail account. NOTE: this code is not completely functional, as I removed the password from the code for security reasons. There are a couple ways to include the password, I originally included mine in a separate file. |
| Word Replacement Program  | This program takes a string and replaces a word in that string with another word of your choice. I used the built-in 'replace' method to do this quickly      |
| Basic Calculator          | In this project, I created a very simple calculator that has the user imput which operation they want to use as well as the 2 numbers they are operating with. The calculator comes up with an answer and continues running until user decides to exit.       |
| Email Slicer              | In this program, the user enters an email address as an input. From here, the program splits the username and from the domain and top-level domain, breaking the email address into 3 parts.      |
| Binary Search Algorithm   | Brief description here       |
| Quiz Program              | In this program, I created a dictionary that held a few quiz questions. The goal is to prompt the user for each question and upon answering, it will let them know if they were correct. After the questions were answered, a score is shown at the end.      |
| QR Code Generator         | This program simply generates a QR code from a given link that the user inputs     |
